This is a batch file for Windows that creates PDFs from DOC files with a single click.

1. Suppose there is a folder named X containing 100 .doc files (Microsoft Word files).
2. Download the .bat file from here and paste it into that directory.
3. Then, double-click the file, and it will open a command prompt (CMD) window.
4. That's it! It will automatically convert all the files into PDFs.

Thank you.
